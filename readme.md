This is a remake of an old school game for Mac os 9.
Since this game is somehow difficult to play on modern computer,
This is an effort to enjoy this game today.

All the love and the credits for the original game goes to Peter N Lewis from https://www.stairways.com/main/
All the assets are (badly) inspired from the originals by myself.

This is python3 and pygame based.
